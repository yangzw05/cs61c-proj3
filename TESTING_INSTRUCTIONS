TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

To test your CPU, run "make cpu"
This will dump a logfile called 'TEST_LOG' in the current directory. To view the 
content, run "cat TEST_LOG". It's a good idea to zoom out in your terminal since 
the lines in log are long.

To test your ALU with registered funct, run "make alu"
This will also dump a logfile as above.

Logfiles are overwritten every time you run a test.
