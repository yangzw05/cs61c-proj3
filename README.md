This repository contains the third course project I completed when I self learned UC Berkeley CS61C online.

ALU and Regfile / CPU - A two-part project that involved using Logisim to implement a simple 32-bit two-cycle processor that is compatible with machine code outputs from MARS and my Project 2.

Part (a) - implement the Regfile and ALU. (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su15/projs/04/)

Part (b) - complete the pipelined processor. (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su15/projs/05/)
